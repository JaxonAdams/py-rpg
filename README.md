This is a simple RPG built in python using the pygame library. To run the game, first ensure you have the necessary packages downloaded:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

You can then run the game by navigating to the `code` directory and running `main.py`:

```
cd code
python main.py
```

Move your character with the arrow keys on your keyboard. You can cycle through weapons and spells by pressing `q` amd `e` respectively.

Attack by pressing the spacebar. Spells can be cast with the left control key.

Open the upgrade menu by pressing the `m` key. You can then spend experience points (bottom right of screen) on upgraded stats with the spacebar.

This project was built alongside ClearCode's [youtube tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QU1pPzEGrqw) on pygame.
